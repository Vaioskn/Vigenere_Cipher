# Vigenere_Cipher

**This is a simple Vigenère encryption/decryption implementation in javascript and Bash.  
I have created a website and written a bash script that both implement the Vigenère encryption algorithm. The Vigenère algorithm uses a 26 × 26 matrix (number of letters of the English alphabet from A to Z). This matrix is commonly referred to as the Vigenère matrix. My script accepts as input from the keyboard the text you wish to encrypt/decrypt and the encryption/decryption key. The encrypt function displays the result of encryption whereas the decrypt function displays the result of decryption.  
The [website](https://github.com/Vaioskn/Vigenere_Cipher/) is an easy-to-use alternative that does the same thing in a user-friendly environment. It also visualizes the proccess which the algorithm uses to establish the output, helping the user understand how both the encryption and decryption work.**

# Syntax_Bash

 **• Encryption: ./vigenere -e -p [TEXT] -k [KEY]**
 **• Decryption: ./vigenere -d -c [TEXT] -k [KEY]**
